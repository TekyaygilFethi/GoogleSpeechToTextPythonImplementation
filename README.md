16. Your JSON file should be downloaded to your PC. Save it with safe! We will be using this JSON file for Google API Authentication.

### Setting Up GCP Storage

17. Search for Storage from the searchbox and select the Cloud Storage:
<img width="1394" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28951869/167875497-e229c349-8c17-445b-84c0-352bf910548a.png">

<img width="1091" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28951869/167875783-69e02628-881f-45ee-aa5b-8d24b3e8fea4.png">

19. Name your bucket (which should be unique worlwide) and click Next for every step until you create a bucket. Now you are in your bucket
<img width="1089" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28951869/167876156-41696e6f-baa1-485a-87e0-07728bc2d32a.png">
This bucket will hold you audio files which will be translated into texts. You may upload you files here.


20. I'm uploading my file name 'uzuntrim.wav' here. My audio file here has the wav extension.


# Demo
21. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone ...
```

22. Create a new virtual environemnt:
```bash
python3 -m venv myvenv
```

23-1. Activate your virtual environment (FOR MAC):
```bash
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

23-2. Activate your virtual environment (FOR WINDOWS):
```bash
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

NOTE: If you got error like this;
<img width="1352" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28951869/167883817-9d48042c-99cb-4c64-b885-88dfd0ca7c7e.png">
You should do the following:

- Start Windows Powershell as Administrator
- Type ```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned``` and hit enter
- When Powershell waits for your input, enter ```A``` and hit Enter button

Now you should be able to move forward with the venv activation script

24. Install all the requirements via the following command:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
25. Add your JSON file that is being downloaded at step 16 to the main directory of the project.
26. Add .env file to you main directory of the project. This file should contain the name of your JSON file with the key of JSON_NAME.
```
JSON_NAME={name}.json
```
27. In ```main.py``` file, you should change this line:
```python
audio = dict(uri="gs://diarizationuv/uzuntrim.wav")
```
with the corresponding url you've taken from GCP Storage. To achieve this just select your desired audio file from Cloud platform and click to the 3 dots at the right o that line. Then choose ```Copy gsutil URI``` option.

28. If you have a recoÄ±rding more than 1 minute, you should use ```speech_to_text_long``` but if you have a recording that is not exceeding 1 minute, you may use ```speech_to_text``` functions in ```main.py``` file.

29. You should set your ```language_code``` parameter in your config dictionary which is in ```main.py``` file according to your audio's language. For example if your audio contains Turkish language, then you should set the language_code parameter as ```tr-TR'```

30. To run the python script, enter the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
31. And you should be able to see the results:

32. CONGRATULATIONS! Now you converted your speech audio into text :)
